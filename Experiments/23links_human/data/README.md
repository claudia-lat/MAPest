This data are necessary for running this code.  They come from the acquisiton of the force plates (`AMTIdata020.txt`, `TSdata020.txt`), from the suit (`Meri-020.mvnx`, `Meri-020.trc`) and from the robot (`torsoState020.txt`, `rightLegState020.txt`, `leftLegState020.txt`, `rightArmState020.txt`, `leftArmState020.txt`, `robotRight020.txt`, `robotLeft020.txt`).

`fileSetup.xml`: template filled with the marker data coming from the suit and it is mandatory for the OpenSim computation.

`iCubGenova02.urdf` : file used for force estimation on the robot in the experiments.
